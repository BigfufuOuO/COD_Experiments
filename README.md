# Information
This is a repository concerning experiments of the course Computer Organization and Design offered on 2023 Spring. It aims to learn and experiment with the priciples of organization in RISC-V, master the method of designing CPUs, and synthesize the developed CPU to achieve desired functionality. The software that the course mainly uses is Vivado version 2019.1. 
The object is still in progress.
## Labs list
The whole experiments were divied into 6 independent tasks. Briefly, these tasks can be reckoned as 2 major parts. Lab 1-3 are the preparation of CPU design, including basic elements and utility of assembly language. Lab 4-6 are intergrated CPU design tasks.
- Lab1: ALU
- Lab2: Memory
- Lab3: Assembly Language
- Lab4: Single-cycle CPU
- Lab5: Pipeline CPU

**Note:** Experiment report was lost in another computer (not mine), though it submitted successfully. Thus a briefly introduction to these two lab is needed, which could be found in the filefold.
